Description:
Agent-based models are a common tool for studying social and socio-environmental systems. Such models are never perfect surrogates of the target system - facing incomplete knowledge or unresolvable uncertainties, modellers must resort to simplifications and hypotheses. But what are the consequences of these unverifiable assumptions on the model's behavior?

Exploratory modelling (EM) is a method of systematically exploring alternative parameter values and model mechanisms, allowing the implications of modelling assumptions to be studied. In this tutorial, we will discuss both theory and practice of exploratory modelling. We will start by reviewing different types of uncertainties that modellers encounter when making (agent-based) simulation models of real-world systems. Then, we will do a practical exercise in Python using *Mesa*, an agent-based modelling package, and the *EMA Workbench*, a computational toolkit for exploratory modelling and analysis. Together, we will study a toy model and discuss three exploratory modelling methods:
* *open exploration*: systematic exploration of model uncertainties
* *sensitivity analysis*: studying which model elements have the largest effect on its output
* *scenario discovery*: searching for combinations of assumptions and conditions which generate specific model behavior

We invite both novice and experienced modellers to participate. Experience with Mesa or Python will help, but is not mandatory. We will provide source code and instructions for all presented methods. Participants can work either in cloud environments such as `Google Colaboratory` or `Deepnote`, or their own preferred Python environments. Finally, these papers might be useful to read beforehand:
