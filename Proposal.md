Description:
Agent-based models are a common tool for studying social and socio-environmental systems. But such models are never perfect surrogates of the target system - facing incomplete knowledge or unresolvable uncertainties, modellers must resort to simplifications and hypotheses. But what are the consequences of these unverifiable assumptions on the model's behavior?

Exploratory modelling is a method of systematically exploring alternative parameter values and model mechanisms, allowing the implications of modelling assumptions to be studied. In this workshop, we will discuss both theory and practice of exploratory modelling. We will first discuss the different types of uncertainties modellers encounter when making (agent-based) simulation models of real-world systems. Then, we will do some practical exercises in Python using `mesa`, an agent-based modelling package, and the `ema-workbench`, a framework for exploratory modelling and analysis. Together, we will take a case study and apply three exploratory modelling methods:
* *open exploration*: systematic exploration of model uncertainties
* *sensitivity analysis*: studying which model elements have the most effect on its output
* *scenario discovery*: searching for the combinations of assumptions and conditions which generate specific model behavior

We will provide the source code and computing environments for all exercises. No preparation is required, although these papers might be useful to read beforehand:
