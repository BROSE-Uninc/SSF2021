Description of your session (350-400 words):
Option 1: Social systems are complex AND we use models to encode our knowledge about them BUT understanding the implications of that knowledge exceeds our brain capacity THEREFORE we should use exploratory modelling to systematically study them.

Option 2: Social systems are often studied with models AND these models are full of uncertainties BUT these uncertainties have a huge influence on model outputs THEREFORE  we should systematically explore them.

Option 3 aka RDM: Social systems are often studied with models AND these models are full of uncertainties BUT these uncertainties have a huge influence on model outputs THEREFORE to find a robust policy (that will work under all circumstances) we need to systematically explore them. (maybe, from the theory point of view this is too far)

social simulation is full of uncertainties, which can only be studied with exploratory modelling.=

Here goes the problem. Social simulation does not take into account uncertainty. What a pity.
The process of modelling socio-technical systems is hard. Say something about post-normal science.
It is important to take into account multiple uncertainties surrounding the system of interest. Give examples. Talk about black swans?
There are different ones: parametric and structural.
To analyse a complex interplay we need to have not only a theory but also tools.

Now, the purpose.
The workshop is twofold. First, participants will be given a short summary of the relevant concepts. Second,
