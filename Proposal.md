Description:
Agent-based models are a common tool for studying social and socio-environmental systems. Such models are never perfect surrogates of the target system (Ackoff, 1993) - facing incomplete knowledge or unresolvable uncertainties, modellers must resort to simplifications and hypotheses. But what are the consequences of these unverifiable assumptions on the model's behavior?

Exploratory modelling (EM) is a method of systematically exploring alternative parameter values and model mechanisms, allowing the implications of modelling assumptions to be studied (Bankes, 1993). In this tutorial, we will discuss both theory and practice of exploratory modelling. We will strat by reviewing different types of uncertainties that modellers encounter when making (agent-based) simulation models of real-world systems. Then, we will do a practical exercise in Python using `Mesa`, an agent-based modelling package (Masad & Kazil, 2015), and `EMA Workbench`, a computational toolkit for exploratory modelling and analysis (Kwakkel, 2018). Together, we will take the case study and apply three exploratory modelling methods:
* *open exploration*: systematic exploration of model uncertainties
* *sensitivity analysis*: studying which model elements have the most effect on its output
* *scenario discovery*: searching for the combinations of assumptions and conditions which generate specific model behavior

We invite both young and experienced modellers to participate. Experience in NetLogo or Python will help, but not mandatory. To speed up the tutorial we ask participants to install the following in advance:
* an open-source version of `Anaconda distribution Individual Edition` (Anaconda Inc, 2020)
* `Mesa` (Project Mesa Team, 2016) and `EMA Workbench` (Kwakkel, 2018) Python packages
* `Slack` (Slack Technologies, 2020) as communication platform (a workspace will be created for the tutorial)

We will provide source code as a set of IPython Notebooks along with computational environments needed to execute those. Also, we will upload a set of instructions on how the proposed methods could be integrated into the participants' work. Finally, these papers might be useful to read beforehand:
