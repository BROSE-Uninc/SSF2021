Short description goes here.

A couple of words about the model first. As can be easily spotted from the name of the model, we will simulate the spread of the *virus* on a *network*. The nodes are computers and the network is a computer network (but of course, global pandemic won't let us to escape from drawing parallels with the spread of the COVID-19). Each node can be in one of SIR states: 

* susceptible,
* infected,
* recovered.

And how the infection happens? Each time tick infected node tries to infect 

## How do I do SA?
- There are many methods to do SA
- You need to select one of them based on your model
- The methods that are relatively robust to ... are
- Second you need to select a pacakge
- Here are your options 

## How to use this repo?
- 3 notebooks
- One has a full  
- Second will be use during the session
- If you want to use on your machine please follow our short isntallations instructions

To demonstrate the use of SA we used a [Mesa]() simulation model written in Python. But guess what? It can be a [NetLogo](https://pynetlogo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model as well. And a [Vensim](https://vensim.com/vensim-software/) model. And even an Excel model ðŸ¤¯!
